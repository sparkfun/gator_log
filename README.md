[*SparkFun gator:log - micro:bit Accessory Board (DEV-15270)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15270)

The gator:log is the perfect data logging tool for your next experiment. With the automation of the data collection process, gone are the days of rushing around with a pen and composition notebook to simultaneously record data and your observations. The gator:log allows a student(s) to focus more on what is happening in the experiment than watching a thermometer or sensor readout.

Instead of using pin connections or requiring soldering, this product provides connection pads for a more kid freindly experience with alligator clips. The design intention of this product is to be used with the [gato:bit (v2)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15162), and the [micro:bit development board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14208).
